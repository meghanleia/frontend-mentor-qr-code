Frontend Mentor QR Code Challenge
I joined Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io) to learn web development. This is my first challenge solution, the requisite "QR Code" that seems to be a popular first project. 

The purpose of the challenge is to replicate a static page with a QR code, and to get it looking identical to the design preview. You can see the challenge without having to create an account here: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H. The design preview can be found in this repository. 

Constructive feedback is appreciated and will help me on my coding journey. You can also find me on Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/meghanleia).
